## Overview

This was my fourth and final project on General Assembly’s Software Engineering Immersive course.  Given the choice to either work individually or in a group, I chose to work in a pair - keen to further my pair-programming skills as well as widen the scope of work that I could achieve within the week timeframe.

We were given just over a week to build a full-stack application, using a Python Django API and Django REST Framework to serve data from a PostgreSQL database whilst consuming this API with a separate front-end, built with React. 

Our idea was Sharebnb.  Taking inspiration from the outrageous and luxurious properties presented on TV series such as Selling Sunset, whilst combining this with the concept and styling behind websites suchas Airbnb -  Sharebnb is a platform where users can swap houses with other users. Users can advertise their house for swapping, as well as explore and make requests on other houses, add properties to their favourites, and leave reviews on properties they have stayed in.

This Readme will outline the approach we took and the wins and challenges that I encountered along the way.

## Brief

* **Build a full-stack application** by making your own backend and your own front-end
* **Use a Python Django API** using Django REST Framework to serve your data from a Postgres database
* **Consume your API with a separate front-end** built with React
* **Be a complete product** which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple of models
* **Implement thoughtful user stories/wireframes** that are significant enough to help you know which features are core MVP and which you can cut
* **Have a visually impressive design** to kick your portfolio up a notch and have something to wow future clients & employers. **ALLOW** time for this.
* **Be deployed online** so it’s publicly accessible.

## Approach Taken

**Planning**

* Having learnt the importance of thorough planning in previous projects, we spent the first 24 hours coming up with a concrete plan for our project - confirming how we wanted the site to look and what functionality we wanted to build. 
* Having both used Trello in Project 3, we used this as our main focal point of keeping track of tasks that we needed to carry out and dividing up the work. 
![](readme-screenshots/trello-board.png)
* We came up with detailed wireframes as well as an ERD Diagram so that we were both clear on what entities we were going to include within our database and the relationships between those entities. This really helped when it came to building our models in the back-end.

**Development:**

**Back-End**


* Knowing that our project was relatively ambitious, and keen to devote enough time to working on the front-end, we decided to pair-code the back-end as we believed this would be the most efficient use of our time and we also both wanted to cement our understanding of how to set up a Django & Python based API. We took turns coding, whilst the other oversaw the process - this worked relatively well and we had finished most of the back-end by Day 3. 
* We started the development of the back-end by creating our models for all the different entities - properties, property types, offers, reviews and users. As we made the models, we established the relationships between the different entities - including one-to-one and many-to-many relationships as displayed below:

```
from django.db import models
from django.core.validators import MinValueValidator, MaxValueValidator

class Review(models.Model):
    text = models.TextField(max_length=300)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    rating = models.IntegerField(validators=[MinValueValidator(1), MaxValueValidator(5)])
    property = models.ForeignKey(
        "properties.Property",
        related_name="reviews",
        on_delete=models.CASCADE
    )
    owner = models.ForeignKey(
        "jwt_auth.User",
        related_name="posted_reviews",
        on_delete=models.CASCADE
    )

    def __str__(self):
        return f"Review - {self.id} on Property - {self.property}"


```

* We built out the serializers for each model as we went, before moving onto setting up REST Framework - and the different get, put, post, delete requests for each entity.  We also worked don user authentication to limit certain requests to logged-in users and owners of certain properties / reviews:

```
class PropertyListView(APIView):

    permission_classes = (IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly, )

    def get(self, _request):
        properties = Property.objects.all() #querying property from index
        serialized_property = PopulatedPropertySerializer(properties, many=True) #expect a list
        return Response(serialized_property.data, status=status.HTTP_200_OK)

    def post(self, request):
        request.data['owner'] = request.user.id
        property_to_create = PropertySerializer(data=request.data)
        if property_to_create.is_valid():
            property_to_create.save()
            return Response(property_to_create.data, status=status.HTTP_201_CREATED)
        return Response(property_to_create.errors, status=status.HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY)

```

* As we had done in project 3, we spent the first few nights putting together a thorough seed database to populate our site with lots of properties and users. 


**Front-End**

* Happy with the back-end, and having tested all requests were working using Insomnia, we moved onto building the front-end using a React framework. Happy to work individually on different tasks on the front-end, I was responsible for both the main index page (& map) and the profile page. 
* I enjoyed the styling of the index page - using flexbox and flex-wrap, I feel the finished look is slick and professional.
* I decided to add a secondary nav bar on the index pages - in order to add the tabular option between map and list view as well as add in a search bar.  For the search bar, I created a function where the user can search the list of properties by City, Country or continent:

```
  const filterProperties = (event) => {
    const results = properties.filter(property => {
      return property.city.toLowerCase().includes(event.target.value.toLowerCase()) ||
        property.country.toLowerCase().includes(event.target.value.toLowerCase()) ||
        property.continent.toLowerCase().includes(event.target.value.toLowerCase())
    })
    setFilteredProperties(results)
  }

```


* I started looking at adding in an additional filter option - using a multi-select checkbox to filter the properties by type. However due to time-constraints and happy that the search option was a sufficient option for our MVP, I was not able to finalise the functionality of this.

* I also focussed lots of my time on the different forms - for example the register a property form. An interesting part of this was adding the different property types which best described that property. For this bit, I used react-select. Below is the code snipped for the function I set up to handle the multi-select options chosen on the form.

```
 const handleMultiSelectChange = (selected, name) => {
    const selectedItems = selected ? selected.map(item => item.value) : []
    handleChange({ target: { name, value: selectedItems } })
  }


// Return:

<div className="field">
            <label className="label">Select Relevant Property Types</label>
            <div className="control">
              <Select 
                options={types}
                isMulti // boolean implied to be true without = {}
                name="types"
                onChange={selected => handleMultiSelectChange(selected, 'types')}
              />
            </div>
          </div>

```

* Another main focus of mine was the profile page. I wanted to mimic a typical social media profile page - showing the number of followers, following and properties. I was happy with the overall styling and finish of the profile page.
*  In particular, I spent a lot of time working on the house swap request swhich proved to be quite complex, especially the accepting or rejecting of the requests. I did not realise that this would involve setting up another REST ‘put’ request in the back-end in order to ‘update’ the request that had been created.  I also had to add a Nested Serialiser for the offer in order to change the boolean is_accepted to true.

```
  const handleAcceptRequest = async event => {
    event.preventDefault()
    try {
      console.log(event.target.name)
      const requestId = event.target.name
      formdata.is_accepted = true
      await editPropertyRequest(requestId, formdata)
      setisAccepted(true)
      // console.log(data)
    } catch (err) {
      console.log(err)
    }
  }

```

```
from rest_framework.serializers import ModelSerializer
from rest_framework import serializers
from ..models import Offer

class NestedOfferSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Offer
        fields = ('is_accepted', )


// Request:

    def put(self, request, pk):
      offer_to_update = Offer.objects.get(pk=pk)
      updated_offer= NestedOfferSerializer(offer_to_update, data=request.data)
      if updated_offer.is_valid():
            updated_offer.save()
            return Response(updated_offer.data, status=status.HTTP_202_ACCEPTED)
      return Response(updated_offer.errors, status=status.HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY)

```

* Using semantic UI Framework, I found a component that I thought would work well for the requests and I was really happy with the final product. 

```
<Card.Content extra>
                            {!offer.is_accepted  ? 
                              <div className='ui two buttons'>
                                <Button basic color='green' name={offer.id} onClick={handleAcceptRequest}>
            Accept
                                </Button>
                                <Button basic color='red'>
            Decline
                                </Button>
                              </div>
                              :
                              <div className='ui two buttons'>
                                <Button basic color='green'>
        Accepted
                                </Button>
                                <Button as={Link} to={`/properties/${offer.offered_property.id}`} basic color='green'>
                            View Property
                                </Button>
                              </div>
                            }
                          </Card.Content>

```

* I enjoyed using the dependency ‘moment’ to convert complex date and time structures in our project, something that was entirely new to me and which worked well.  I used this to convert the dates for the ‘Joined Sharebnb: x Days Ago’ as well as for the dates on the house swap requests. We also used this dependency for the time on the reviews - eg. Posted 2 hours ago.

```
import moment from 'moment'
moment().format()

return :


 <p>Joined Sharebnb: <small className="text-muted px-1">{moment(profile.date_joined).fromNow()}</small></p>

||

<Card.Description>
                      Dates: {moment(offer.start_date).format('MMM Do YY')} to {moment(offer.end_date).format('MMM Do YY')}
                            </Card.Description>


```




## Challenges

* A main challenge for me was getting my head around the user of serializers in the back-end and using these in a way so that I had the correct output in the front-end.  Whilst I was setting up the ‘house swap requests’ in the front-end I kept coming across instances where I was not receiving the correct data in the requests (eg. The details of the owner of the request were not displaying). I then had to go back to the back-end and alter the serializers, adding in nested serializers in a few cases. In future, I would clearly think out what data would be attached to each model and what serializers were necessary so that the correct information would be returned and to avoid having to alter the back-end later down the line.

```
from rest_framework import serializers
from ..models import Property


class PropertySerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Property
        fields = '__all__'

class NestedPropertySerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Property
        fields = ('id', 'name', 'property_image', 'city', 'country', 'owner')

```
* As mentioned in the process section, I was not able to implement the multi select checkbox to filter the properties by type. I was dissapointed not to be able to do this but it is a work in progress.


## Wins
* Considering we had only been learning Python and Django for just a week, I was impressed with the fact that we were able to build a full-stack app which was based in Python and Django. Overall, we were really happy with the amount of functionality that we achieved and how our site looked.
* I was happy with how I carried forward my understanding of how relationships were established from my previous projects, and adapted this knowledge for the Python and Django back-end. I was pretty happy with how the 'house swap requests' worked both in the back-end and front-end.

## What I Learned
* As this was my first project using Python and Django, I learned a huge amount. It was interesting to translate my knowledge and understanding of JavaScript and put into practice everything we had learned over the duration of the course in general. 
* I enjoyed using Django - it was interesting to compare how it worked to setting up an API with Express. The error handling was way easier to set up and I enjoyed learning the benefits of using different frameworks.
* It was a great chance to further my pair-programming skills and I loved working a pair. I took what I had learned from the previous group projects (both failures and successes) and applied those learnings to ths project, which I believe resulted in a relatively smooth and successful project.

## Future Features

* Work In Progress: Implementing the multi-select checkbox feature on the index page to filter properties by type. 
* If we had more time, we would have liked to work more on our styling - making the website fully responsive to both smaller screens and mobiles. I would also have liked to add more animations, something I learned about in my previous projects from my team-mates but would be keen to implement myself.
* I would also have liked to add the functionality where users are notified about new requests (or accepted requests) - eg. adding a notification feature on the navbar.
* At the current moment, the error messages are also quite generic for our forms so I would like to build these up to a point where they are more specific and inform the user what the exact error is.
