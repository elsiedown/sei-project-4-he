## Overview

This was my fourth and final project on General Assembly’s Software Engineering Immersive course.  Given the choice to either work individually or in a group, I chose to work in a pair - keen to further my pair-programming skills as well as widen the scope of work that I could achieve within the week timeframe.

We were given just over a week to build a full-stack application, using a Python Django API and Django REST Framework to serve data from a PostgreSQL database whilst consuming this API with a separate front-end, built with React. 

Our idea was Sharebnb.  Taking inspiration from the outrageous and luxurious properties displayed on TV series such as Selling Sunset, whilst combining this with the concept and styling behind websites suchas Airbnb, Sharebnb is a platform where users can swap houses with other users. Users can advertise their house for swapping, as well as explore and make requests on other houses, add properties to their favourites, and leave reviews on properties they have stayed in.

This Readme will outline the approach we took and the wins and challenges that I encountered along the way.

## Collaborators

* Hugo Kinahan - [Github](https://github.com/hugokinahan)
## Brief

* *Build a full-stack application* by making your own backend and your own front-end
* *Use a Python Django API* using Django REST Framework to serve your data from a Postgres database
* *Consume your API with a separate front-end* built with React
* *Be a complete product* which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple of models
* *Implement thoughtful user stories/wireframes* that are significant enough to help you know which features are core MVP and which you can cut
* *Have a visually impressive design* to kick your portfolio up a notch and have something to wow future clients & employers. *ALLOW* time for this.
* *Be deployed online* so it’s publicly accessible.

## Challenges
* A main challenge for me was getting my head around the user of serializers in the back-end and using these in a way so that I had the correct output in the front-end. 

## Wins
* Considering we had only learnt Python and Django over the course of a week, I was impressed with the fact that we were able to build a full-stack app using these skills. Overall, we were really happy with the amount of functionality that we achieved and how are site looked.
* I was happy with how I carried forward my understanding of how relationships were established from my previous projects, and adapted this knowledge for the Python and Django back-end. I was pretty happy with how the 'house swap requests' worked both in the back-end and front-end.

## What I learned
* As this was my first project using Python and Django, I learned a huge amount. It was interesting to translate my knowledge and understanding of JavaScript and put into practice everything we had learned over the duration of the course in general.
* It was a great chance to further my pair-programming skills and I loved working a pair. I took what I had learned from the previous group projects (both failures and successes) and applied those learnings to ths project, which I believe resulted in a relatively smooth and successful project.

## Future Features

* If we had more time, we would have liked to work more on our styling - making the website fully responsive to both smaller screens and mobiles. I would also have liked to add more animations, something I learned about in my previous projects from my team-mates but would be keen to implement myself.
* I would also have liked to add the functionality where users are notified about new requests (or accepted requests) - eg. adding a notification feature on the navbar.
* At the current moment, the error messages are also quite generic for our forms so I would like to build these up to a point where they are more specific and inform the user what the exact error is.
