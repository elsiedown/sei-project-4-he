## Overview

This was my fourth and final project on General Assembly’s Software Engineering Immersive course.  Given the choice to either work individually or in a group, I chose to work in a pair - keen to further my pair-programming skills as well as widen the scope of work that I could achieve within the week timeframe.


We were given just over a week to come up with an app which was based in Python and Django in the back-end and which used a React.js framework in the front-end.


Our idea was Sharebnb.  Sharebnb 

This Readme will outline the approach we took and the wins and challenges that I encountered along the way.

## Collaborators

* Hugo Kinahan - [Github](https://github.com/hugokinahan)

## Brief

* *Build a full-stack application* by making your own backend and your own front-end
* *Use a Python Django API* using Django REST Framework to serve your data from a Postgres database
* *Consume your API with a separate front-end* built with React
* *Be a complete product* which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple of models
* *Implement thoughtful user stories/wireframes* that are significant enough to help you know which features are core MVP and which you can cut
* *Have a visually impressive design* to kick your portfolio up a notch and have something to wow future clients & employers. *ALLOW* time for this.
* *Be deployed online* so it’s publicly accessible.
